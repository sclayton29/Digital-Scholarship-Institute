2. Connect to your ArcGIS Online account for the workshop.
   - account setup information will be emailed to each participant
   
## Workshop Learning Objectives:
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1. Describe the basic characteristics of geospatial data and functions of a GIS.
2. Summarize the major components and considerations for creating and maintaining an example GIS/mapping project.
3. Perform a common geospatial data manipulation task with direct applications for supporting the use of library map collections in digital scholarship projects.
4. Use ArcGIS Online to complete common, project-oriented tasks, including importing, analyzing, visualizing, and sharing geospatial data and associated web maps.

## Workshop Agenda:
1. Welcome and introductions (5 min.)

2. Introduction to spatial thinking (20 min.)
   - LO1: Describe the basic characteristics of geospatial data and functions of a GIS.
   
3. Digging into digital scholarship projects (40 min.)
   - LO2: Summarize the major components and considerations for creating and maintaining an example GIS/mapping project.
   - How'd they make that? - In small groups, we will analyze a current GIS project to understand its audience, necessary expertise to create the project, and how we might support such a project. We will share out our results and discuss as a larger group.
   
4. Georeferencing historical maps (25 min.)
   - LO3: Perform a common geospatial data manipulation task with direct applications for supporting the use of library map collections in digital scholarship projects.
   - We will learn how to identify places on a scanned map and to define its location so that it can be used in combination with other data layers.
   
5. Break (30 min.)

6. Building a web map with ArcGIS Online (75 min.)
   - LO4: Use ArcGIS Online to complete common, project-oriented tasks, including importing, analyzing, visualizing, and sharing geospatial data and associated web maps.
   - We will learn the basics of ArcGIS Online, including creating a new map, navigating the interface, searching for and adding data in a variety of formats, changing layer styles, working with attributes, and performing common spatial analysis tasks. We will be using locally-relevant data sets, with a focus on public art locations in Rochester.
   
7. Closing discussion (15 min.)
