# TL;DR
Before the Institute, do these things!
1. ~Fill out a short, silly survey: https://forms.gle/mSPAy4Vq1C2bzCg8A~
2. Install [OpenRefine](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions) and [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) (and create a free Tableau profile).
3. Explore 2-3 interesting charts at [data-to-viz.com](http://data-to-viz.com/) 

# Workshop Details

In this workshop, participants will not simply learn about data visualization, but will learn about the entire process of data analysis that begins with collection and ends with visualization.

## Instructors
This workshop will be taught by Megan and Eileen. Feel free to email them questions beforehand if anything is unclear.
- [Megan Ozeran](mailto:mozeran@illinois.edu), Data Analytics & Visualization Librarian, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
- [Eileen Daly-Boas](mailto:edaly@library.rochester.edu), Librarian for Philosophy & Education, Outreach, Learning, and Research Services, University of Rochester

## Learning outcomes
1.	Participants will be able to explain the lifecycle of data analysis.
2.	Participants will be able to use several common data-related tools at a basic level.
3.	Participants will be able to find resources that can help with analysis projects.

## Survey
(The survey is now closed.) Choosing a dataset to explore can be difficult since everyone has different interests. We decided that participants will create and analyze their own data. To this end, we designed a [survey](https://forms.gle/mSPAy4Vq1C2bzCg8A) to generate an interesting dataset to explore. 

In addition to the 2019 participants, past DSI participants and instructors have been invited to complete the survey to increase the number of responses. The survey questions are presented in random order. All survey questions are optional and you can leave the survey at any time. All responses are anonymous. If you have questions or concerns about this survey, please contact Megan or Eileen.

## Accounts and Installations
We will be using a couple different tools in the workshop. To help the workshop itself run smoothly, please install the following software beforehand. If you have trouble with installations, there is a lot of information online that can help. If all else fails, feel free to contact Megan or Eileen.
1. [OpenRefine](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions)
2. [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/) - Make sure to also create a free profile, as this is the only way to save your work.

While it is not required, you may also want to ensure you have a way to view .csv files. Microsoft Excel is the most common software for this, and you probably already have it through your organization.

## Homework
Please take some time to explore a few charts at [data-to-viz.com](http://data-to-viz.com/). It is likely that some of the charts will be familiar to you, while others will not. We recommend exploring several that you are less experienced with. You may also want to read some of [the caveats](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html) they discuss, or Google additional examples of the chart types you explored. Be prepared to discuss the charts you explored with a small group in the workshop.
