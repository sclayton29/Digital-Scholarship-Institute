# TL;DR
Before the Institute, do these things!
1. Fill out a short, silly survey: https://forms.gle/mSPAy4Vq1C2bzCg8A
2. Explore 2-3 interesting charts at [data-to-viz.com](http://data-to-viz.com/) 

# More Information

In this workshop, participants will not simply learn about data visualization, but will learn about the entire process of data analysis that begins with collection and ends with visualization.

## Learning outcomes
1.	Participants will be able to explain the lifecycle of data analysis.
2.	Participants will be able to use several common data-related tools at a basic level.
3.	Participants will be able to find resources that can help with analysis projects.

## Pre-Institute survey
Choosing a dataset to explore can be difficult since everyone has different interests. We decided that participants will create and analyze their own data. To this end, we designed a [survey](https://forms.gle/mSPAy4Vq1C2bzCg8A) to generate an interesting dataset to explore. 

In addition to the 2019 participants, past DSI participants and instructors have been invited to complete the survey to increase the number of responses. The survey questions are presented in random order. All survey questions are optional and you can leave the survey at any time. All responses are anonymous. If you have questions or concerns about this survey, please contact Megan Ozeran at mozeran@illinois.edu or Eileen Daly-Boas at edaly@library.rochester.edu

## Pre-Institute homework
Please take some time to explore a few charts at [data-to-viz.com](http://data-to-viz.com/). It is likely that some of the charts will be familiar to you, while others will not. We recommend exploring several that you are less experienced with. You may also want to read some of [the caveats](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html) they discuss, or Google additional examples of the chart types you explored. Be prepared to discuss the charts you explored with a small group in the workshop.
