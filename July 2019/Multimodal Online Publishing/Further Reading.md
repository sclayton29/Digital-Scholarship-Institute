# Getting Started
* [Scalar 2 User's Guide](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/index): a thorough guide to every aspect of Scalar, including layouts, paths, visualziations, etc.
* [QuickStarts](http://scalar.usc.edu/works/guide2/quickstarts?path=index): part of the User's Guide. A good place to start for basic instructions for getting started and generating content without all of the what/why details.
