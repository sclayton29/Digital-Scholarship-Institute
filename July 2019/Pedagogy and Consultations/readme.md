Leigh captures the reality of digital scholarship consultations and will start you thinking about the critical questions and partners to consider during the consultation process. She also links to a ton of great resources for follow-up work after the Institute.

**Session Outcomes**
1. Generate key questions for project consultations in order to understand how librarian consultation skills are the underpinning to a good DS consultation.
2. Articulate potential partners for the DS case study in order to conceptualize the range of expertise you may need to call on for a DS project.
3. Identify 2-3 people with whom to talk about DS upon returning home, creating actionable next steps.

**Case study scenario**

May 12, 2019

Dear [librarian]:

I was talking with my colleague Johan Fakersson, and he suggested I contact you about the course I’m prepping for this fall, HIST 3901: Methods in Public History.  As a through line for the course, we’ll be looking at the history of immigration in the Frogtown neighborhood of St. Paul, including earlier European immigrants up through more recent Vietnamese and Hmong immigration waves. The students will be getting a variety of hands-on experience with archives, oral histories, working with communities, etc. As part of the course, I’d like the students to build a database or an interactive website to share the documents, images, and stories from the neighborhood. We’ll be building on my work with the Hmong community, so we have a starting set of images and texts from community partners. 

I’m not sure what technology or platform to use for this project. I’d like the students to work with community members to create descriptions and context/bios. This would also be a good opportunity for them to engage with some digital humanities tools. I’ve been able to get funding from the Provost’s Office for a TA as part of the campus community-engaged scholarship initiative, which should help. Are you available to meet to talk about this project next week?

Best,
