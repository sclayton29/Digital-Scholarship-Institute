                    <p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">NE</hi> January day, thirty years ago, the little town
                        of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be
                        blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the
                        cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky.
                        The dwelling-houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some
                        of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they
                        were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain. None of
                        them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them
                        as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen
                        hard, which ran from the squat red railway station <pb n="4"/> and the grain
                        "elevator" at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse
                        pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows
                        of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug
                        store, the feed store, the saloon, the post-office. The board sidewalks were
                        gray with trampled snow, but at two o'clock in the afternoon the
                        shopkeepers, having come back from dinner, were keeping well behind their
                        frosty windows. The children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad
                        in the streets but a few rough-looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with
                        their long caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their
                        wives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one
                        store into the shelter of another. At the hitch-bars along the street a few
                        heavy work-horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their blankets.
                        About the station everything was quiet, for there would not be another train
                        in until night.</p>

                    <ab>On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little <persName
                            ref="#Bergson_Em">Swede boy</persName>, crying bitterly. He was about
                        five years old. His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him
                        look like a little old man. His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed
                        many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt
                        and the tops of his clumsy, copper-toed shoes. His cap was pulled down over
                        his ears; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold. He
                        cried quietly, and the few people who hurried by did not notice him. He was
                        afraid to stop any one, afraid to go into the store and ask for help, so he
                        sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him,
                        whimpering, "My kitten, oh, my kitten! Her will fweeze!" At the top of the
                        pole crouched a shivering gray kitten, mewing faintly and clinging
                        desperately to the wood with her claws. The boy had been left at the store
                        while his sister went to the doctor's office, and in her absence a dog had
                        chased his kitten up the pole. The little creature had never been so high
                        before, and she was too frightened to move. Her master was sunk in despair.
                        He was a little country boy, and this village was to him a very strange and
                        perplexing place, where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts. He
                        always felt shy and awkward here, and wanted to hide behind things for fear
                        some one might laugh at him. Just now, he was too unhappy to care who
                        laughed. At last he seemed to see a ray of hope: his sister was coming, and
                        he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes. <persName ref="#Bergson_Al"
                            >His sister</persName> was a tall, strong girl, and she walked rapidly
                        and resolutely, as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was
                        going to do next. She wore a man's long ulster (not as if it were an
                        affliction, but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her; carried
                        it like a young soldier), and a round plush cap, tied down with a thick
                        veil. She had a serious, thoughtful face, and her clear, deep blue eyes were
                        fixed intently on the distance, without seeming to see anything, as if she
                        were in trouble. She did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by
                        the coat. Then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face.
                        "Why, <persName ref="#Bergson_Em">Emil</persName>! I told you to stay in the
                        store and not to come out. What is the matter with you?" "My kitten, sister,
                        my kitten! A man put her out, and a dog chased her up there." His
                        forefinger, projecting from the sleeve of his coat, pointed up to the
                        wretched little creature on the pole. Oh, Emil! Did n't I tell you she'd get
                        us into trouble of some kind, if you brought her? What made you tease me so?
                        But there, I ought to have known better myself." She went to the foot of the
                        pole and held out her arms, crying, "Kitty, kitty, kitty," but the kitten
                        only mewed and faintly waved its tail. <persName ref="#Bergson_Al"
                            >Alexandra</persName> turned away decidedly. "No, she won't come down.
                        Somebody will have to go up after her. I saw the Linstrums' wagon in town.
                        I'll go and see if I can find Carl. Maybe he can do something. Only you must
                        stop crying, or I won't go a step. Where's your comforter? Did you leave it
                        in the store? Never mind. Hold still, till I put this on you." She unwound
                        the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat. A shabby little
                        traveling man, who was just then coming out of the store on his way to the
                        saloon, stopped and gazed stupidly at the shining mass of hair she bared
                        when she took off her veil; two thick braids, pinned about her head in the
                        German way, with a fringe of reddish-yellow curls blowing out from under her
                        cap. He took his cigar out of his mouth and held the wet end between the
                        fingers of his woolen glove. "My God, girl, what a head of hair!" he
                        exclaimed, quite innocently and foolishly. She stabbed him with a glance of
                        Amazonian fierceness and drew in her lower lip&#8212;most unnecessary
                        severity. It gave the little clothing drummer such a start that he actually
                        let his cigar fall to the sidewalk and went off weakly in the teeth of the
                        wind to the saloon. His hand was still unsteady when he took his glass from
                        the bartender. His feeble flirtatious instincts had been crushed before, but
                        never so mercilessly. He felt cheap and ill-used, as if some one had taken
                        advantage of him. When a drummer had been knocking about in little drab
                        towns and crawling across the wintry country in dirty smoking-cars, was he
                        to be blamed if, when he chanced upon a fine human creature, he suddenly
                        wished himself more of a man? While the little drummer was drinking to
                        recover his nerve, Alexandra hurried to the drug store as the most likely
                        place to find Carl Linstrum. There he was, turning over a portfolio of
                        chromo "studies" which the druggist sold to the Hanover women who did
                        china-painting. Alexandra explained her predicament, and the boy followed
                        her to the corner, where Emil still sat by the pole. "I'll have to go up
                        after her, Alexandra. I think at the depot they have some spikes I can strap
                        on my feet. Wait a minute." Carl thrust his hands into his pockets, lowered
                        his head, and darted up the street against the north wind. He was a tall boy
                        of fifteen, slight and narrow-chested. When he came back with the spikes,
                        Alexandra asked him what he had done with his overcoat. "I left it in the
                        drug store. I could n't climb in it, anyhow. Catch me if I fall, Emil," he
                        called back as he began his ascent. Alexandra watched him anxiously; the
                        cold was bitter enough on the ground. The kitten would not budge an inch.
                        Carl had to go to the very top of the pole, and then had some difficulty in
                        tearing her from her hold. When he reached the ground, he handed the cat to
                        her tearful little master. "Now go into the store with her, Emil, and get
                        warm." He opened the door for the child. "Wait a minute, Alexandra. Why

                        father can't get better; can't get well." The girl's lip trembled. She
                        looked fixedly up the bleak street as if she were gathering her strength to
                        face something, as if she were trying with all her might to grasp a
                        situation which, no matter how painful, must be met and dealt with somehow.
                        The wind flapped the skirts of her heavy coat about her. </ab>
